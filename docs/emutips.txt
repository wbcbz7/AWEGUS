on position update and emu8000 quirks (again):
P = pos, S = loop start, E = loop end

gf1: TBD
    S > E:
        P <  E: P counts to E, then:
        P >= E: P stops at S (forward) or E (ping-pong), P >= E condition always true 

emu8000:
    S < E: 
        P <  E: P counts to E, then resets to S
        P >= E: position overflow, either plays backwards to E then resets to S and plays normally,
                or quickly jumps forward and wraps to 0, then plays normally
    S > E:
        P <  E: P counts to E, then position overflow
        P >= E: position overflow
    
    this means, in some combinations, P could overflow during register update
    gf1 handles it fine, while emu8k sends you into the ROM

possible solutions:
if channel is stopped (ctrl & 3 != 0), set pitch to 0, that will stop chan at current sample
if new E <= P, save current P, set P to 0x100 (this has sample 0, may click but at l), then set new E
if new S >= E, do the same, plus set E to end of DRAM (emualte GF1 behavior). restore if (S < E)!
if new P >= E, save updated P in emu state but write 0x100 to emu8k

in all three cases, mute the channel, don't forget to unmute after start!
(this does not match with GF1 behavior but at least eliminates some of the clicks)

if channel is started (ctrl & 3 == 0), unconditionally restore P (if hasn't rewritten)

another variant:
if new E <= P:
    - save new E in emu8k state, read and save current P in emu8k state(?)
    - set pitch = 0
    - write P = S = E-1-(pitch>>14) to emu8k
    - restore pitch

if new P >  E:
    - save new P and E in emu8k state
    - set pitch = 0
    - write P = S, E = S+1+(pitch>>14) to emu8k
    - restore pitch if playing

if new S >= E:
    - save S, E, read and save P in emu8k state
    - set pitch = 0
    - write P = S = E-1-(pitch>>14) to emu8k
    - restore pitch if playing

this will match with GF1 behavior, afaik. anyway, needs more testing :)

during channel stop, do not write new pitch/volume to emu8k, save in state
in all cases, set "full position restore" flag, which becomes active when channel is started (ctrl & 3 != 0)
if so:
    - restore S, E, P (in that order), then pitch and finally volume
