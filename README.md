# AWEGUS - Gravis Ultrasound "emulator" for Sound Blaster AWE32/64

absolutely work in progress



## Contents

* JAWEGUS - Jemm-based version (for real-mode V86-compatible applications, and possibly DPMI protected mode ones if DPMI server is able to reflect and use Jemm's I/O traps)



## Build

You need Open Watcom C/C++ compiler (both 1.9 and v2 should work fine, make sure 16 and 32-bit DOS target support is installed) and Netwide Assembler.

Switch to corresponding directory, run `make`, grab .exe, done :)
